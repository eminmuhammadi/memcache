## Reporting a Vulnerability 

Memcache team and community take all security vulnerabilities
seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open source 
software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance.
